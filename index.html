                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello, I am Bluberie. I like petting dogs. My favorite dog is one that looks like a dog. Please buy my merch, it is very nice. My favorite food is blueberries. I wish there were more blueberries in this country. I will be running for president, please vote for me. I like crocs. I want to be an adult when i grow up. I can't wait for the minions movie. I'm really excited, I wish it came out earlier. Can't wait to see Kevin, he's a really cool minion. I am majoring in mechanical engineering, but my car still brok. I am double majoring in german as well, but I also don't know how to german.</p>
